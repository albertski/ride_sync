# RideSync

RideSync is a scheduled ride service. Drivers get the freedom to choose from a list of upcoming rides that align with their schedule and preferences.

## Setup

- Copy `example.env` to `.env`
- Create Google Platform API Key and add it to  `GOOGLE_API_KEY` inside .env file
- Setup Database
```
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
```

## Google Integrations

- DirectionService: Used to fetch driving information between addresses (each lookup is cached for 1 hour)
- GeocodeService: Use to fetch the longitude and latitude values of the address. In order for the Address to get geocoded, you need set `geocode_address` to true.  For example:
```
Address.new(address1: '123 North Broadway', city: 'Chicago', state: 'IL', zip_code: '60613', country: 'United States', geocode_address: true).save
```
